# Scraper

This is a personal project I'm rewriting to enhance my programming skills. It builds on a program I created to address a workplace issue. The project is currently a work in progress, now incorporating a database for improved functionality. I'm quite pleased with the progress so far!

## Scripts Overview

### `database.py`
Demonstrates the database's functionality through a series of operations:
- Creates a database file named `parts_database.db`.
- Supports adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting parts.
- Designed to run as a standalone program.
- Note: The numbers used are example values and are not functional with the scraper.

### `part_finder.py`
Scrapes data from `rockymountainatvmc.com` and adds it to the database.
- Utilizes **Playwright** for web scraping and **customtkinter** for the GUI.
- Runs the GUI and scraping in separate threads to maintain UI responsiveness.
- Main function initializes the browser, starts the GUI, and manages scraping logic.
- **How to use**:
  1. Run the script to open a browser and GUI window.
  2. Navigate through a brand, select options in dropdowns until reaching a schematic page.
  3. Highlight a part number, copy it, and paste it into the GUI's entry box.
  4. Click the "Scrape" button to add the part number to the database.

### `scraper.py`
Processes a list of instructions generated by `database.py`.
- Requires parts to be added to the database via `part Ufinder.py` first, as it captures navigation instructions.
- Gathers in-stock status and price of parts, and updates superseded part numbers.
- Note: Direct URLs cannot be used due to the dynamic nature of the website, as URLs change periodically.

### `ebay_interface.py`
Interacts with eBay's Trading API using the **ebaysdk** library (requires an API key, not included for security reasons).
- Retrieves all active listings from the user's eBay account and saves them to a JSON file.
- Updates the database with eBay listing IDs to link parts directly to eBay listings.
- Includes a function to calculate pricing based on Rocky Mountain pricing, factoring in transaction fees, shipping costs, and desired profit margin.
- Note: This script is non-functional without a valid eBay API key.

## Notes
- This project is still under development, with ongoing improvements to the database and scraping functionality.
- To test `scraper.py`, ensure parts are added to the database using `part_finder.py` first.

Thank you for checking out my project!
